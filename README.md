# Incoming

Incoming is a "game" I made for Computing Sciences class in Grade 10.

It draws inspiration largely from the "Parachute" game on the old
iPod classics, in turn presumably inspired from other old games
such as Missle Command.

Unfortunately, the class wrote their games using 
[AppGameKit Classic](https://www.appgamekit.com/),
including myself.
This is a closed-source piece of software, technically paid for.
However, if you don't mind having a watermark in the corner of the screen,
you can download a free trial version and use it indefinitely.
There are no other limitations to my knowledge.

## Building
Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP from GitHub.

**Due to licensing reasons**, the file `media/outfit.png` has been omitted
from this repository. You will need to find a suitable replacement yourself
**before attempting the build**. Otherwise, you will get errors when you try
to run the game.
The image was originally of a maid outfit, but it could be anything you want.

Open the `incoming.agk` project in AppGameKit and press "Run". That's it.

## The bugs...
There are a large number of bugs that critically affect gameplay.

I had given up on the game by the time I finished, so I decided not to fix
them.

As I am posting this for historical purposes only, I don't anticipate
I will be fixing any of them.

**Please do not file pull requests over bugs!**

## Credits and Licensing
The main game code is under the MIT Licence. Images and sounds are
under varying licences, see `LICENCE` for more details.
